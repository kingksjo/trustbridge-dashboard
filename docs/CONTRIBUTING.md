   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run test
   npm run build
   ```

## Pull request guidelines

### Before opening a PR

- [ ] Issue linked (if applicable)
- [ ] `.env.example` updated if new env vars added
- [ ] Docs updated in `docs/` and linked from README
- [ ] `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` pass
- [ ] No secrets committed

### PR title format

Use conventional prefixes:

| Prefix | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation only |
| `refactor:` | Code change without behavior change |
| `chore:` | Tooling, deps, CI |

Example: `feat: add testnet Horizon toggle`

### PR description

1. **What** changed
2. **Why** it was needed
3. **How to test** locally

## Project conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled — avoid `any`
- Shared types in `src/types/`
- Server-only logic in `src/lib/`, not in client components

### Components

- UI primitives: `src/components/ui/`
- Feature components: `src/components/`
- Use `"use client"` only when needed (hooks, browser APIs)

### Styling

- Tailwind utility classes
- Stellar brand: `stellar-purple` (#3E1BDB), `stellar-cyan` (#00B4D8)
- Support dark mode via `next-themes`

### API routes

- Use `export const runtime = "nodejs"` for stellar-sdk routes
- Use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` for DB-backed routes
- Return structured JSON errors with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Database

- Schema changes require Prisma migration or documented `db:push` step
- Update [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) if data model changes

## Reporting bugs

Include:

1. Steps to reproduce
2. Expected vs actual behavior
3. Browser/OS version
4. Relevant env config (redact secrets)
5. Console or server logs

---

## Feature requests

Open an issue describing:

- Problem statement (e.g. "Maintainers can't filter by org team")
- Proposed solution
- Alternatives considered

## Questions?
